### SNP_Down_the_Background
##### A program for removing background anomalies that compiles relevant non-background SNPs from multiple files into a single location
Background anomalies are SNPs and indels that have been found by variant calling softwares and are also present in your sequencing control as well as your samples. As such, these anomalies may not be required for further study and can be filtered out if there are too many to sort through manually.

This program only works with .vcf file formats.
